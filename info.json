    "body": "At Trojan, we strive to make cryptocurrency trading accessible to everyone. You are welcome to start trading with any amount, even with less than $1. This allows you to familiarize yourself with the platform and test its features before committing a larger investment. However, we recommend beginning with a balance that you are comfortable with.\n\nPlease note: When trading with smaller balances, be mindful of network gas fees. These fees can significantly affect the profitability of your trades, especially when operating with minimal amounts. For a more effective trading experience, we suggest a minimum trade amount of $5 to help mitigate the impact of network costs on your transactions.\u200b",

    "description": "",
    "body": "List of Common issues you can encounter when Copy Trading.\n\n1. Slippage Exceeded: \n- up your slippage settings in your copy trade module. \n- To what? \n- Consider increasing 3-5% at a time until it doesn\u2019t fail. \n- Work back down 1-2% at a time from there.\n- Review and ensure you\u2019re not trying to copy a sniper (see below).\n\n2. Copy Trade is slow to execute: \n- Check your settings.\n- Is your gas tip high enough? Turbo (.0075) or higher recommended.\n- Ensure you are not attempting to copy a sniper.\n- Use Dexscreener.com to identify when the wallet buys.\n- Go to the token and sort the maker by the wallet you\u2019re trying to copy.\n- If the wallet is among the first 3 seconds, you are likely copying a sniper.\n- This strategy can be extremely unsuccessful.\n\n3. Copy Trade does not work, troubleshooting:\n- Confirm you\u2019ve activated the copy trade module by clicking \u2795Add.\n- Confirm you have the appropriate target wallet set up\n- Review Solscan.io to ensure your target wallet is trading in supported pools.\n- Supported pools: Raydium AMM, CLMM, Meteora and Jupiter Routed Trades.\n- Unsupported pools: Directly through ORCA or FluxPools\n- Check solscan.io to ensure you are not copying a sniper or custom program.\n- Open a buy transaction in legacy mode.\n- If you see \u201cInteract with System Program\u201d you cannot copy this wallet.\n- Only copying sells? Review for custom program in a buy tx. \n\n4. Why can\u2019t I copy a sniper?\n- Proper snipers bots spam 100s to 1000s of tx's and cannot be copied.\n- Snipers often leverage custom programs that cannot be copied.\nNote: IF you find a sniper you can copy, remember you are exit liquidity: \n- they buy first block \n- you buy the top of the sniper candle\n- Sniper dumps massively\n- You sell the absolute bottom.\n\n5. Why can\u2019t I copy a custom program?\n- we don't support copy trading custom programs, because they can be malicious and fake swaps in order to exploit copy trading bots.\n- it is likely if you\u2019re copying an individual using a custom program to buy, you will copy sells because they are selling directly through a copiable setup.\n\n6. Failed to Send transaction (when selling):\n- Ensure you have not been blacklisted/frozen (rugged) by checking your token account on solscan.io. \n1. Go to your wallet on Solscan.io\n2. Click portfolio \n3. Find the token you\u2019re looking for \n4. Click through to the account. \n5. Top right see if the account is frozen\n- Not enough tokens on your balance to sell\n- Sale initiated by your copied trader before your buy has been completed",

    "body": "Market Price Execution:\nLimit Orders are executed at the Market Price once triggered. Because market prices can fluctuate rapidly, there might be a difference between your trigger point and the actual fill price.\n\nImpact of Slippage Settings:\nThe variance in fill price is influenced by the slippage settings you select. Slippage allows for a price range within which your order can be executed to ensure it fills despite market movements.\n\nExample:\nSuppose you set a slippage of 10%. If your order triggers at a price of $1, the fill price could be as low as $0.90 or as high as $1.10. This range accommodates the potential price fluctuation at the time of execution.\n\nMarket Volatility and MEV Protection:\nIf you experience a significant disparity between the trigger price and the fill price, it could be due to high market volatility or the absence of MEV (Miner Extractable Value) Protection. Without MEV Protection, your transaction could be vulnerable to being \"front-run\" by MEV bots, which prioritize their transactions in the order queue, potentially affecting your order\u2019s execution price.\n",
